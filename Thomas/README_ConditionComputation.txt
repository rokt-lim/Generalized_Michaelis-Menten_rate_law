File name: ConditionComputation.py

*** System requirement
- Windows, Linux or macOS
- Python 3.7 or greater
- "ConditionComputation.py" requires Numpy 1.15.1 or greater

*** General information
The file "ConditionComputation.py" takes the .npy files Phasev1, PhasetQSSA and PhasesQSSA generated by "PhaseSimComputation.py" and generates three npy files

*** Main modules

-Phasev1_CondA.npy : The list of phase shift between Cgamma and Cfull when at least one of the absolute values of the three phase shifts is greater or equal than 1 hour

-PhasetQSSA_CondA.npy : The list of phase shift between CtQSSA and Cfull when at least one of the absolute values of the three phase shifts is greater or equal than 1 hour

-PhasesQSSA_CondA.npy : The list of phase shift between CsQSSA and Cfull when at least one of the absolute values of the three phase shifts is greater or equal than 1 hour
