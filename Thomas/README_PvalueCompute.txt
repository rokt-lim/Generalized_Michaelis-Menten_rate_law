*** System requirement
- Windows, Linux or macOS
- Python 3.7 or greater
- "PvalueCompute.py" requires Scipy 1.1.0 or greater and Numpy 1.15.1 or greater.

*** General information
"PvalueCompute.py" contains functions to compute p values used in the part III. BIOPHYSICAL APPLICATIONS, section B. Proteinâ€“protein interaction, each of these functions take one parameter Number, an integer that determine the precision of the test.
"PvalueCompute.py" requires .npy files generated by PhaseSimComputation.py (PhasetQSSA.npy, PhasesQSSA.npy, Phasev1.npy, SimtQSSA.npy, SimsQSSA.npy, Simv1.npy), by ConditionComputation.py (Phasev1_CondA.npy, PhasesQSSA_CondA.npy, PhasetQSSA_CondA.npy) and by the function RandomGenerate in the file ComputeFunctionsAndEpsilon.py (epsilon_gamma_Table.npy and epsilon_tQ_Table.npy)
Each function returns an information and p value 

*** Main module
- P_valuePhase_tQSSA_v1 : returns the difference between the median of absolute phase shifts of CtQ and the median absolute phase shifts of Cgamma and the associated p value

- P_valuePhase_sQSSA_v1 : returns the difference between the median of absolute phase shifts of CsQ and the median absolute phase shifts of Cgamma and the associated p value

- P_value_PhaseCondA_1hour : returns the number of cases when the absolute phase shift of Cgamma is smaller than both absolute phase shift of CtQ and CsQ by at least 1 hour and the associated p value

- P_value_PhaseCondA_2hour : returns the number of cases when the absolute phase shift of Cgamma is smaller than both absolute phase shift of CtQ and CsQ by at least 2 hours and the associated p value

- P_value_Spearman_Sim_tQSSA_v1 : returns the Spearman correlation coefficient between the similarity after phase correction with Cfull of Cgamma and CtQ and the associated p value

- P_value_Sim_v1_sQSSA : returns the difference between the median of similarities of Cgamma and the similarities of CsQ and the associated p value

- P_value_Sim_tQSSA_sQSSA : returns the difference between the median of similarities of CtQ and the similarities of CsQ and the associated p value

- P_value_Spearman_phasev1_Epsgamma : returns the Spearman correlation coefficient between the max of epsilon gamma on one period and the absolute phase shift of Cgamma and the associated p value

- P_value_Spearman_phasetQSSA_EpstQ : returns the Spearman correlation coefficient between the max of epsilon tQ on one period and the absolute phase shift of CtQ and the associated p value
