File name: PhaseSimComputation.py

*** System requirement
- Windows, Linux or macOS
- Python 3.7 or greater
- "PhaseSimComputation.py" requires Scipy 1.1.0 or greater,
Numpy 1.15.1 or greater, and Matplotlib 2.2.3 or greater.

*** General information
The file "PhaseSimComputation.py" takes as input the .npy files List_Parameter.npy, C_full_Table.npy, C_tQSSA_Table.npy, C_sQSSA_Table.npy and C_v1_Table.npy generated by the function RandomGenerate in "ComputeFunctionsAndEpsilon.py" and generate 6 .npy files

*** Main module
-PhasetQSSA.npy : List of phase shift between tQ and full solution for each set of parameters

-PhasesQSSA.npy : List of phase shift between sQ and full solution for each set of parameters

-Phasev1.npy : List of phase shift between gamma and full solution for each set of parameters

-SimtQSSA.npy : List of similarity after phase correction between tQ and full solution for each set of parameters

-SimsQSSA.npy : List of similarity after phase correction between sQ and full solution for each set of parameters

-Simv1.npy : List of similarity after phase correction between gamma and full solution for each set of parameters

The file also contains a function Scatter_Plot

This functions takes 7 parameters as input:
-L1, L2 : List of values to compare on x and y axis respectively
-Name1, Name2 : Strings for caption of x and y axis respectively
-Title : Stings, name of the figure
-xmin, xman : real numbers, boundaries of the figure
