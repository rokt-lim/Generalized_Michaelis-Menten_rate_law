*** General information
This code is for the numerical simulation of
the ZEITLUPE (ZTL)-GIGANTEA (GI) interaction. This interaction follows
dC(t)/dt = k_a [A(t) - C(t)]*[B(t) - C(t)] - k_delta C(t).
- C(t) is the concentration of GI-binding ZTL at time t (unit = nM).
- A(t) and B(t) denote the total concentrations of ZTL (unit = nM) and
GI (unit = nM).
- k_a denotes the association rate of free ZTL and free GI (unit = nM^-1 hour^-1).
- k_delta is defined as k_delta = k_d + r_c.
- k_d is the dissociation rate of GI-binding ZTL (unit = hour^-1).
- r_c is the degradation rate of GI-binding ZTL (unit = hour^-1).
- k_a can be computed by using k_a = k_delta/K where K (unit = nM) is
the Michaelis constant.
- Because blue light enhances the ZTLâ€“GI interaction, we assume that k_d and K in light
do not exceed k_d and K in darkness, respectively.
- k_d_D >= k_d_L; k_d_L is the dissociation rate of GI-binding ZTL in light and
k_d_D is the dissociation rate of GI-binding ZTL in darkness.
- K_D >= K_L; K_L is the Michaelis constant in light and
K_D is the Michaelis constant in darkness.

The ZTL (A(t)) turnover dynamics can be described by the following equation:
dA(t)/dt = g_A(t) - r_c*C(t) - r_A*[A(t) - C(t)].
- g_A is the ZTL synthesis rate (unit = nM hour^-1).
- r_A is the degradation rate of free ZTL (unit = hour^-1).

In the code, delta_tQ is defined as follows:
delta_tQ = (K + A + B)^2 - 4*A*B.
